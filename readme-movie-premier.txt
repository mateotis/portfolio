Project Name: 30 Minute Film Festival Premiere

Project Description:
The centrepiece of this webpage is a short video me and three of my fellows created in about 30 minutes during one of our first classes. After a bit of thought, we decided to make a parody ad for Zoom, where the class was held. I was in charge of all the editing (which I have very little experience with), so it was a hectic process and we just about managed to "finish" it in time. True to the video's concept, I wanted to make the webpage themed around the idea of it being a sarcastic promotion for Zoom, urging the user/viewer to download this "beautiful" piece of software.

Process: 
From the get go, I knew I wanted to embed this page into a larger portfolio website (that we'll create at the end of the semester) to make it more personalised to myself. My first design (which I submitted as a wireframe) reflected that and not much else: a navbar header with my name and a few tabs, a footer with misc info, and between them the video with a title and short description. This might have sufficed for a portfolio showcase where the video was the only important part, but that wasn't the case here - so I had to get more creative!

I was inspired by the self-aware ad videos we watched for the class and that's the vibe I wanted to aim for. Unfortunately, I'm not a very visual person (my brain just doesn't work like that, which is a significant challenge when your biggest passion is creative writing), so the first challenge was coming up with a simple but coherent design that sold (get it?) my idea.

While I don't know much about colour theory, I figured that sticking to a colour scheme that matches the product I was "advertising" (aka Zoom) was a good idea. I also wanted to avoid my site looking like one of those early 2000s Geocities/Wordpress pages with a million clashing colours and fonts. So I stuck to three: black for most text (and the header/footer), white for the background and some text, and the signature Zoom blue for buttons, boxes, and other shapes.
I thought about colouring the background something, but I couldn't come up with anything that beat the neat clarity of white. Plus, the blue looks really good against it. I guess those Zoom guys knew what they were doing!

Next came the actual content. I wanted the language to be tongue-in-cheek, without being juvenile. I also didn't want too much text - a good ad can be persuasive with a couple well-placed words. Also, the less text you have on the page, the easier it is to guide your user without overwhelming them, which is critical for UX.
Playing around with font size came in handy here for that purpose, allowing me to draw attention to (or away from) specific parts of the page, just like regular ads do.

I came up with the idea of presenting a few questions to the user which they had to "answer" to progress when I was thinking about exactly what sort of JS interactivity I wanted to add. Having elements appear on click is simple enough to implement while also giving the user a bit of agency - agency that I gleefully subvert in this case, forcing the user to answer affirmatively to the ad's loaded questions. When they first load the page, they only see a question, and a button to "answer" it - when they inevitably click it, a second one is revealed. Then a third, after which the rest of the page is revealed, because Rule of Three and any more of this linear clickthrough would have quickly become annoying.

Also, I think it's very funny to assume that Zoom is really the answer to all the user's burning problems. :D

I ended up loving the concept of interactively hiding/revealing information so much so that I practically based the whole design around it. There is the aforementioned button clickthrough, there is changing info when you hover over the boxes, I even had some fun with link tooltips. I think overall these pieces make the site into a little puzzle, which doesn't take long to "solve" at all, but I hope that the user still has fun while doing so.

The video still takes centre stage, too (once it's revealed), and it reinforces pretty much everything I say on the website, so I think it all ended up coming together quite nicely.

Reflection:
Obviously, the site changed a lot from my first designs. It went from being a portfolio showpiece to a fun, interactive experience on its own, WHILE still being embedded into the bigger picture. Overall, I'm happy with the final product. I did want it to be more animated than it turned out to be, but that's solely because of my lack of web development experience. I'm hoping that, once I learned more, I can revisit and revise this page and make it to the zany Zoom ad it was always meant to be!

One final comment on writing the actual code (since most of my related comments are IN the code): I had no problems with the HTML and JS portions, but I struggled quite a bit with CSS. It's like an endless toolbox that can do anything, but you HAVE to know what you're looking for. But then again, that's why we have Google. :)
